This repository houses "A Primer on Bezier Curves",
written using LaTeX formulae for the mathy bits, and
Processing.js sketches for the interactive graphics.

The article itself is (c) 2011-2013 to me, Mike "Pomax"
Kamermans, but all the .pde source code is in the
public domain. If you want to use it, for whatever
purpose, go for it. Although if you make several
million dollars thanks to this article, a donation is
of course always appreciated =P
