        <p>Now that we understand (well, superficially anyway) the component functions, we can find the extremities of our
        Bézier curve by finding maxima and minima on the component functions, by solving the equations B'(t) = 0 and B''(t) = 0.
        Although, in the case of quadratic curves there is no B''(t), so we only need to compute B'(t) = 0.</p>

        <p>The problem with this is that as the order of the curve goes up, we can't actually solve those equations the normal
        way. We can't take the function, and then work out what the solutions are. Not to mention that even solving a third
        order derivative (for a fourth order curve) is already a royal pain in the backside. We need a better solution. We
        need numerical approaches.</p>

        <p>That's a fancy word for saying "rather than solve the function, treat the problem as a sequence of identical
        operations, the performing of which gets us closer and closer to the real answer". Finding solutions to any
        <i>f(t) = 0</i> is called "root finding", and there is a really nice numerical root finding algorithm, called
        the Newton-Raphson root finding method (yes, after <strong>that</strong> Newton).</p>

        <div class="note">
          <h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Raphson">Newton-Raphson</a> root finding</h2>

          <p>The Newton-Raphson approach consists of picking a value <i>t</i> (any will do), and getting the corresponding
          value at that <i>t</i> value. For normal functions, we can treat that value as a height. If the height is zero,
          we're done, we have found a root. If it's not, we take the tangent of the curve at that point, and extend
          it until it passes the x-axis, which will be at some new point <i>t</i>. We then repeat the procedure with this
          new value, and we keep doing this until we find our root.</p>

          <p>Mathematically, this means that for some <i>t</i>, at step <i>n=1</i>, we perform the following calculation
          until <i>f<sub>y</sub></i>(<i>t</i>) is zero, so that the next <i>t</i> is the same as the one we already have:</p>

          <p>\[
            t_{n+1} = t_n - \frac{f_y(t_n)}{f'_y(t_n)}
          \]</p>

          <p>(The wikipedia article has a decent animation for this process, so I'm not adding a sketch for that here)</p>

          <p>Now, this works well only if we can pick good starting points, and our curve is continuously differentiable
          and doesn't have oscillations. Glossing over the exact meaning of those terms, the curves we're dealing with
          conform to those constraints, so as long as we pick good starting points, this will work. So the question is:
          which starting points do we pick?</p>

          <p>As it turns out, Newton-Raphson is so blindingly fast, we don't really have to pick: we simply run the
          algorithm from <i>t=0</i> to <i>t=1</i> at small steps (say, 1/200<sup>th</sup>) and the result will be
          all the roots we want. Of course, this may pose problems for high order Bézier curves: 200 steps for a
          200<sup>th</sup> order Bézier curve is going to go wrong, but that's okay: there is no reason, ever, to
          use Bézier curves of orders higher than 10, let alone 100.</p>
        </div>

        <p>With this, we can determine the first and second derivative roots for our Bézier curves, and show them
        in our previous graphics:</p>
